Singleton Design Pattern
=======================================

This is a type of creational design pattern where the creation of a class object is restricted. The singleton class has only one 
object throughout the applicaiton's life.

A single class has below properties
1. A static object
2. Private constructor- so that no clien tcan instantitate the singleton on its own.
3. A globally accessible static method which returns the static object to the client when demanded.




Early instantiation
--------------------------------
The Singleton class is instattiated beforehand only, means even client doesn't demand the object.

Late instantiation
----------------------------------
Class in instantiated when required.
